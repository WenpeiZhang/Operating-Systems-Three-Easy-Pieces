1. Programming interface provided by operating system is **system call**.
2. **Privilege instruction** refers to *the instructions that can only be executed by operating system.*
3. The 5 basic states of processes are: **new**, **ready**, **running**, **waiting**, **terminated**.
4. In a system there are 10 tape-drivers shared by M processes, each process needs 3 tape-drivers at most, then if **M <=4** , the system can be deadlock free?(deadlock)
5. There are 3 jobs, their running time are 2, 5, and 3 hours. Assume they arrive at the same time, running on the same processor in single programming method; running sequence **J1, J3, J2** will have **the least average turnaround time**.(scheduling)
