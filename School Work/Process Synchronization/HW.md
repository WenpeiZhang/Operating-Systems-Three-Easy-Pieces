>6.1 The first known correct software solution to the critical-section problem for two processes was developed by **Dekker**. The two processes, P0 and P1, share the following variables:
```c
boolean flag[2]; /* initially false */
int turn;
```
>The structure of process Pi (i == 0 or 1) is shown in Figure 6.25; the other process is Pj (j == 1 or 0). Prove that the algorithm satisfies all three requirements for the critical-section problem.

Answer: 

*This algorithm satisfies the three conditions of mutual exclusion.*

*(1) Mutual exclusion is ensured through the use of the flag and turn variables. If both processes set their flag to true, only one will succeed. Namely, the process whose turn it is. The waiting process can only enter its critical section when the other process updates the value of turn.*

*(2) Progress is provided, again through the flag and turn variables. This algorithm does not provide strict alternation. Rather, if aprocess wishes to access their critical section, it can set their flag vari- able to true and enter their critical section. It only sets turn to the value of the other process upon exiting its critical section. If this process wishes to enter its critical section again - before the other process - it repeats the process of entering its critical section and setting turn to the other process upon exiting.*

*(3) Bounded waiting is preserved through the use of the turn variable. Assume two processes wish to enter their respec- tive critical sections. They both set their value of flag to true, however only the thread whose turn it is can proceed, the other thread waits. If bounded waiting were not preserved, it would therefore be possible that the waiting process would have to wait indefinitely while the first process repeatedly entered - and exited - its critical section. However, Dekker’s algorithm has a process set the value of turn to the other pro- cess, thereby ensuring that the other process will enter its critical section next.*

>6.7 Describe how the **Swap()** instruction can be used to provide **mutual exclusion** that satisfies the **bounded-waiting requirement**.
```c
 do {
        waiting[i] = TRUE;
        key = TRUE;
        while (waiting[i] && key)
            key = Swap(&lock, &key);
            waiting[i] = FALSE;
              /* critical section */
            j = (i+1) % n;
            while ((j != i) && !waiting[j])
                j = (j+1) % n;
            if (j == i)
                lock = FALSE;
            else
                waiting[j] = FALSE;
              /* remainder section */
          } while (TRUE);

```
>6.8 Servers can be designed to limit the number of open connections. For example, a server may wish to have only N socket connections at any point in time. As soon as N connections are made, the server will not accept another incoming connection until an existing connection is re- leased. Explain how semaphores can be used by a server to limit the number of concurrent connections.

*Answer: **A semaphore is initialized to the number of allowable open socket connections.** When a connection is accepted, the *acquire()* method is called, when a connection is released, the *release()* method is called. If the system reaches the number of allowable socket connections, subsequent calls to *acquire()* will block until an existing connection is terminated and the release method is invoked.*

>6.9 Show that, if the *wait()* and *signal()* semaphore operations are not executed atomically, then mutual exclusion may be violated.

*Answer: A wait operation atomically decrements the value associated with a semaphore. If two wait operations are executed on a semaphore when its value is 1, if the two operations are not performed atomically, then it is possible that both operations might proceed to decrement the semaphore value thereby violating mutual exclusion.*

>6.10 Show how to implement the *wait()* and *signal()* semaphore operations in multiprocessor environments using the *TestAndSet()* instruction. The solution should exhibit minimal busy waiting.

*Answer: Here is the pseudocode for implementing the operations:*
```c
int guard = 0;
int semaphore value = 0;

wait()
{
    while(TestAndSet(&guard) == 1);
    if(semaphore_value == 0){
        atomically add process to a queue of processes
        waiting for the semaphore and set guard to 0;
        }else{
        semaphore_value--;
        guard = 0;
        }
}

signal()
{
    while(TestAndSet(&guard) == 1);
    if (semaphore value == 0 &&
                     there is a process on the wait queue)
    wake up the first process in the queue of waiting processes
    else
        semaphore_value++;
    guard = 0;
}
```
>6.11 ***The Sleeping-Barber Problem***. A barbershop consists of a waiting room with *n* chairs and a barber room with one barber chair. If there are no customers to be served, the barber goes to sleep. If a customer enters the barbershop and all chairs are occupied, then the customer leaves the shop. If the barber is busy but chairs are available, then the customer sits in one of the free chairs. If the barber is asleep, the customer wakes up the barber. Write a program to coordinate the barber and the customers.

Answer:
(1) BarberShop.java
```c


//This class defines the Barber Shop Scenario.
//This scenario allows N customers to enter it.
//It also contains a number of chairs that allow the customers to wait in.

        for(int i = 0; i < chairNum; i++)
            chairState[i] = EMPTY;
    }

        //if barber shop is full return false

If the barber's state is not sleeping or ocupied, then he can take the customer immediately.
This solution doesn't prevent starvation for the waiting customers.  If A customer finnaly gets notified to leave the waiting state they will be the next haircut.  If another customer enters the shop at the same time, then that customer will always have to wair for existing customers to  be serviced.
