Code1:

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    printf("hello world(pid:%d)\n",(int) getpid());

    if(rc < 0)
    {
        fprintf(stderr, "fork failed\n");
        exit(1);
    }
    else if(rc == 0)//child
    {
        printf("hello, I am child(pid:%d),now x = %d\n", (int) getpid(),x);
    }
    else//parent
    {
        printf("hello, I am parent of %d (pid:%d), now x = %d\n", rc, (int) getpid(),x);
    }
return 0;
}
```

hello world(pid:11694)
hello, I am parent of 11695 (pid:11694), now x = 2017
hello, I am child(pid:11695),now x = 2017
```
Thus, the value of **x** in the child process is still 2017, the same as that in the main process *(parent)*.

Code2:
```c
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
#include<unistd.h>
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    printf("hello world(pid:%d)\n",(int) getpid());
    int x = 2017;
    int rc = fork();
    if(rc < 0)
    {
        fprintf(stderr, "fork failed\n");
        exit(1);
    }
    else if(rc == 0)//child
    {
        int x = 2018;
        printf("hello, I am child(pid:%d),now x = %d\n", (int) getpid(),x);
    }
    else
    {   int x = 2019;
        printf("hello, I am parent of %d (pid:%d), now x = %d\n", rc, (int) getpid(),x);
    }
    printf("Actually, the value of x =%d\n",x);
return 0;
}

```

hello world(pid:11712)
hello, I am parent of 11713 (pid:11712), now x = 2019
Actually, the value of x =2017
hello, I am child(pid:11713),now x = 2018
Actually, the value of x =2017
```
We can see that even though both the child and the parent have changed the value of **x**, while child changed it to 2018 and parent changed it to 2019 (inside the respective braces), the actual value of **x** still remains 2017. Thus, I assume that any changes made to the variable by the child and the parent are only effective within the respective braces as written above.

>2. Write a program that opens a file (with the **open()** system call) and then calls **fork()** to create a new process. Can both the child and parent access the file descriptor returned by **open()**? What happens when they are writing to the file concurrently, i.e., at the same time?

#include<sys/stat.h>

    int num =5;
    fd = open("/Users/apple/Desktop/file.txt", O_RDWR | O_CREAT | O_TRUNC, S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR);
    if(fd == -1)
       fprintf(stderr,"open failed\n");
    else
    {
        printf("Open/Create file successful.\n");

        int rc = fork();//create a new process
        if(rc < 0)
        {
            fprintf(stderr, "fork failed\n");
            exit(1);
        }
        else if(rc == 0)//child
        {
            printf("hello, I am child, the file descriptor is: %d\n",fd);//child tried to access fd
            char buff[100]="CCCCC";
            write(fd,buff,100);
        }
        else//parent
        {
            printf("hello, I am parent, the file descriptor is: %d\n",fd);//parent tried to access fd
            char buff[100]="PPPPP";
            write(fd,buff,100);
        }
        f_size = write(fd,str,num);//write to the file concurrently
        close(fd);
    }
return 0;
}

```
Results:
```
//Terminal

Open/Create file successful.
hello, I am parent, the file descriptor is: 3
hello, I am child, the file descriptor is: 3


//file.txt
PPPPP...(95 "\u0")12345CCCCC...(95 "\u0")12345  
/*Because the number of bytes to be written into the file was assigned "100", 
while at the end of the program it's assigned exactly "5".*/
```
From the above, we now know that both the child and parent can access the file descriptor returned by **open()**.
According to this example, what happens when they are writing to the file concurrently is that parent will write first then the child write. (Is this concurrent though??)

>3. Write another program using **fork()**. The child process should print *“hello”*; the parent process should print *“goodbye”*. You should try to ensure that the child process always prints first; can you do this without calling **wait()** in the parent?

For starters, let's recall how it can be done using **wait()** ！

Code1:
```c
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
#include<unistd.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    int rc = fork();
    if(rc < 0)
    {
        fprintf(stderr,"fork failed\n");
        exit(1);
    }
    else if(rc == 0)//child
    {
        printf("hello\n");
    }
    else//parent
    {
        wait(NULL);//if parent happens to run first then wait for the child
        printf("goodbye\n");
    }
    return 0;
}

```
Result1:
```
Peggys-MacBook-Air:~ Peggy$ vim s3.c
Peggys-MacBook-Air:~ Peggy$ gcc -o s3 s3.c
Peggys-MacBook-Air:~ Peggy$ ./s3
hello
goodbye
```
In this way, we can ensure the child process always prints first!

Now let's make it more interesting! How can we achieve it w/o calling **wait()** in parent?

Code2:
```c
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>
#include<unistd.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    int rc = fork();
    if(rc < 0)
    {
        fprintf(stderr,"fork failed\n");
        exit(1);
    }
    else if(rc == 0)//child
    {
        printf("hello\n");
    }
    else//parent
    {  
       usleep(1000);//1000 microseconds (10^(-3)s) 
       //sleep(1)  1 second  (1s)
       printf("goodbye\n");
    }
    return 0;

```
Results2:
```
Peggys-MacBook-Air:~ Peggy$ gcc -o s3 s3.c
Peggys-MacBook-Air:~ Peggy$ ./s3
hello
goodbye
```
Without using **wait()** , we can use **sleep()** or **usleep()** in the parent procss. In this case, in the parent process, **usleep()** was called. It stopped parent for a certain amount of time, during which the child process started running. As long as child can finish its process within the set length of time, we can ensure that child prints first because once time's up it will switch back to run parent process.(***Actually this depends on the scheduling mechanism of the system***)
